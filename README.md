## Documentation
  This repo contains all the necessary information and resources, as well as progress and updates on the food computer.
## Arduino Configuration
  A "genuino" is currently operating in the place of a genuine arduino uno, as confusing as that sounds. The microcontroller was programmed using the arduino IDE. The code uploaded is contained inside the 'sensor_read.ino' file. The following libraries were installed after being downloaded fromt the below github repositories:\
  Adafruit_Sensor (used for adafruit temperature and humidity sensors): https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor \
  Arduino Library for Maxim Temperature Integrated Circuits (DallasTemperature; used for underwater temperature sensor): https://github.com/milesburton/Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library \
  One Wire Library (also used for underwater temperature sensor): https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/OneWire \
